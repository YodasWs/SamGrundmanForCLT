<p>I'm a critical thinker and problem solver by nature. I earned 2 Bachelor's degrees in pure math and physics from UNC Greensboro and have been working as a web developer since 2011. I have global knowledge and experience as I did a year study abroad to England and taught English in South Korea. I also served on the board of directors for Cape Fear Public Transit Authority in Wilmington, NC. I am now in Charlotte eager to lead.</p>

<p>Traffic is a pain, roads are expensive, and parking decks and parking lots are for idle cars, not active people. It's
	time South Charlotte have a representative who will work to provide you with an easy, stress-free commute and
	cost-effective transportation options, and make sure Uptown and SouthPark are designed for people.</p>
<p>I'm a critical thinker and problem solver by nature. I earned 2 Bachelor's degrees in pure math and physics from UNC
	Greensboro and have been working as a web developer since 2011. I have global knowledge and experience as I did a
	year study abroad to England and taught English in South Korea. I also served on the board of directors for Cape
	Fear Public Transit Authority in Wilmington, NC. I am now in Charlotte eager to lead.</p>
